# Thank you for your interest in Cylium!
There is a lot of work to do, and any contribution is highly appreciated.   

## Creating documentation and tutorials

As the author of Cylium, I write documentation for every new feature added to the language.    
However, sometimes inaccuracies or errors may appear.    
You can help by pointing them out and suggesting improvements via issues!  

You are also welcome to **create new documentation pages or tutorials**.  

**How to contribute:**  
- Write your page in Markdown format, or indicate corrections to an existing page.  
- Submit your contribution via a GitHub issue.  
- Your work may be published on the official website.  

**Important:**  
- All contributions of documentation or tutorials must include **author attribution**    
and be licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).  
- By submitting new pages or corrections, you agree that     
they may be publicly published on the Cylium website under this license.

## Improving the interpreter itself
When contributing to the Cylium interpreter,    
please **follow the language philosophy** and maintain the general coding style.  

**For newcomers:**  
- Start by fixing existing issues or working through the TODO plan.  
- Focus on small, incremental improvements.  

**For experienced contributors:**  
- Clearly indicate your changes in the **changelog**.  
- If you replace one feature with another, **explain your decisions** in the PR.  

**Important:**  
- Pull requests that add new functionality
  **will not be merged until corresponding documentation is written**.  
- Always ensure your code is consistent
  with existing style and design principles of Cylium.

## Reporting
Even opening an issue to report a bug or problem is a valuable contribution. If you have an idea or suggestion,    
that also counts as a contribution and helps the project grow!

## Writing applications using Cylium
Even a small project or a minor feature written in Cylium is a meaningful contribution to our community.  
Sharing your work inspires others and strengthens the ecosystem.
